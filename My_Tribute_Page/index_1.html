                    <h2>Early Life and Career</h2>

                    <p>
                        James O'Neil Bishop II was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and spent his childhood between the
                        shores
                        of Michigan and the sunlit streets of Florida.<br>
                        Before turning thirteen in 1984, he was already working construction sites, mastering the
                        sheetrock
                        trade with a craftsman's eye.<br>
                        As he grew older, he joined a grocery chain, following a path familiar to many of his peers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Active in both school and neighborhood sports, he bore the marks of youthful grit—scraped knees
                        and
                        torn palms from skateboarding, bruises from the track and wrestling mats.<br>
                        He competed in mile relays, the 440-yard dash, high and long jumps, and ran three-mile races
                        with
                        relentless drive.<br>
                        On the wrestling team, he grappled in the 145-pound division, and on the football field, he
                        played
                        with heart.<br>
                        His passion for boxing and martial arts pushed him to accept the challenge of anyone willing to
                        touch gloves.

            <h2>Military Service</h2>
            <p>
                In 1988, at the age of 17, James enlisted in the United States Navy under the Delayed Entry Program -
                leaving for bootcamp in early April 1989, following in the footsteps of his
                father, who had served in the Navy during the Vietnam War.

                    <p>
                        Drawn to the sea like his father—who served aboard the U.S.S. <em>Kitty Hawk</em> in the
                        Pacific
                        fleet—James enlisted in the Navy as a Machinist Mate on the U.S.S. <em>King</em> DDG-41, a
                        guided
                        missile destroyer.<br>
                        There, he took charge of main communications during drills and emergencies, relaying vital
                        information directly to the bridge.<br>
                        As a member of “A-Gang,” he worked in the engine rooms, boiler rooms, emergency diesel
                        generator
                        spaces, and other critical engineering zones.<br>
                        He stood watches, performed preventive maintenance, and cleaned tirelessly—stripping and
                        waxing
                        enough tile to cover all of Washington, D.C. <br> His enlistment ended with an honorable
                        discharge in 1991, as the U.S.S. King DDG-41 was being readied to be decommissioned.

            <p>
                His naval service, combined with later roles as a Class A and heavy equipment operator, laid the
                groundwork for his journey into entrepreneurship—a path built on discipline, resilience, and the
                enduring will to forge his own legacy.
