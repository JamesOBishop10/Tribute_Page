Tribute Page — Phase 1

This project offers a **pure HTML template** — not the most minimal, but intentionally approachable. It’s designed to help beginners and curious coders **push the boundaries of HTML alone**, without relying on CSS or JavaScript (yet).

You can view the rendered page via **GitHub Pages**, allowing you to see how semantic structure and inline styling can shape layout and meaning.

✨ Featured Element Breakdown

```html
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <figure>
        <img src="..." alt="Placeholder Pencil drawing of a cat image">
    </figure>
    <div>
        <h2><em>sub heading emphasized </em></h2>
        <p>...text content...</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

This snippet demonstrates:

- **Inline Flexbox styling** to align image and text side-by-side.
- Use of `<figure>` for semantic image grouping.
- `<em>` for emphasized subheadings.
- `<br>` for manual line breaks (used sparingly).
- A blend of placeholder text and real-world public domain imagery.

 🧭 Your Invitation

Explore the rest of the code. Notice how structure, tags, and minimal styling combine to create meaning. This is **Phase 1** — a foundation. Future phases will introduce CSS and interactivity, but for now, let HTML speak for itself.
