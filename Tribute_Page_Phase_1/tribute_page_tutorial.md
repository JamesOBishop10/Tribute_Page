# Tribute Page Tutorial Guide

This repository contains the starter files and tutorial instructions for building a **Tribute Page** using pure HTML. The goal is to learn HTML structure, semantic tags, and how to host a project with GitHub Pages.

---

## 🌐 Project Preview
Once deployed with GitHub Pages, your project will be viewable here:  
👉 [Live Tribute Page](https://yourusername.github.io/tribute-page/) *(replace with your actual URL once published)*

---

## 📂 Project Setup

1. **Install Git**  
   Download from [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  
   - Git Bash = command line practice.  
   - Git GUI = visual commits.

2. **Install a Code Editor**  
   Recommended: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
   - Extensions: *Live Server*, *Prettier*, *GitLens*.

3. **Create a GitHub Repository**  
   - Name it `tribute-page`.  
   - Clone it locally with Git Bash or GitHub Desktop.

4. **Save Your File**  
   - Place `index.html` in your repository folder.  
   - Open in your browser or use *Live Server* for preview.

5. **Commit & Push to GitHub**  
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push
   ```

6. **Enable GitHub Pages**  
   - Go to **Settings → Pages**.  
   - Select *Deploy from branch* → `main` → `/root`.  
   - Save and copy your project link.

## 📖 How to Use `index.html`

### 1. Header
- Add your tribute subject’s **name** in `<h1>`.  
- Replace the placeholder `<img>` with a profile picture (don’t forget `alt` text).  
- Write a short **introductory paragraph**.

### 2. Sections
Each `<section>` tells part of the story:
- **Early Life and Career** – Paragraphs about their beginnings.  
- **Military/Community/Service** – Service or volunteer work.  
- **Other Life Events** – Important achievements.  
- **Major Accomplishments** – Use a list (`<ul><li>`).  
- **Quotes or Legacy** – Include a quote or summary of impact.

### 3. Links
- Use `<a href="...">` to reference external sources.  
- Add `target="_blank"` so links open in a new tab.

### 4. Footer
- Include your own name or project name.

---

## ♿ Accessibility and Semantics
- Always include **alt text** for images.  
- Use semantic elements: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`.  
- Use `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for images with captions.

---

## 🚀 Optional Explorations
- Add a `<nav>` bar linking to sections.  
- Create multiple versions:  
  - Pure HTML  
  - With CSS  
  - With JavaScript  
- Try `<details>` and `<summary>` for expandable anecdotes.

## 🛠️ Next Steps
Once your HTML-only version is live:
1. Create a new folder or branch for a **CSS-enhanced version**.  
2. Later, create another for **JavaScript interactivity**.  

This way you’ll learn HTML, CSS, and JS in **progressive steps**.

### ✅ Remember
Take your time. Each step is only as difficult as you make it. Test your page in different browsers and devices before moving on.
